- button1 is a variable that is not going to be reassigned. If you are not going to assign a new value to a variable, it is best practice to use the const keyword to declare it instead of the let keyword. This will tell JavaScript to throw an error if you accidentally reassign it.
- Use querySelector() to get the button elements using their ids.
- button1 represents the first button element. These elements have a special property called onclick, which can determine what happens when someone clicks that button.
The innerText property controls the text that appears in an HTML element
- The innerHTML property allows you to access or modify the content inside an HTML element using JavaScript.
- The ternary operator is a conditional operator and can be used as a one-line if-else statement. The syntax is: condition ? expressionIfTrue : expressionIfFalse. In getMonsterAttackValue, return hit is a ternary operator that returns hit if hit is greater than 0, or returns 0 if it is not.
